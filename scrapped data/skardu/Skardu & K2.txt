Asia » Pakistan » Northern Areas » SkarduSeptember 18th 2014 Published: October 3rd 2014Edit Blog PostChina JollyGrand Continental Gilgit.Stayed in Gilgit, biggest city in Northern areas, 'Grand Continental Hotel'  As we left Gilgit we crossed & recrossed the'Danyore Bridge' to get right photo, on old bridge & tunnel, just for pedestrians and bikes now, suspension bridge with one end straight into a tunnel.    A run up to Skardu then seamed a good idea, 'not far' as usual, but turned into a epic 180km of gravel road at times cut back into vertical cliff wall. You might think Pakistan would ease back into open valley and better road after 100k or so, not a chance here it runs hard all way, they are tough here - perhaps why cricket team does so well. Or another view 'no benefit culture here' - if U work then can have some life, but generally people are happy.    Indus river .. Rondu gorge, just staying on road while looking at big river in gorge, spot line down that rapid not too hard, Oops where is bike going? Even parking it close to edge or standing taking video - not without risk. Last 2    K2 hotel, bit of trekkers lodge or base in the town, Tourist info.Rafting or have seen basket transfer too.maybe 60 rooms & a locked car park. Funny how men run hotels here, reception, cleaning, restaurant. Ladies stay home, do agriculture, so as not to be exposed to foreigners, not a full burka area, but certainly very modest.    Fix chain guard, which had been falling off for last 10,000km, needed steel plate to hold it up. Little bike shop were keen, but no power till 2pm - so we can't drill hole! Did not hold us back long, hammer & punch though a bit embossed plate, can now point out the Pakistani part on bike with my boot - look it's tough, locals like that. Fix by 9am, still holding up at 5pm 150km later.    K2 & a few other high mountains are the main attraction here, K2 is a 120km Jeep ride to Askole, then 5 a day trek to Concordia where U can get a photo of the mountain, climbing it is much more time. I could not resist it, ride the Triumph to K2 base camp, how hard can it be? Well quite tough after 65km of gravel and deep sand in places I was still 65km from or Askole Bridge & Tunnel in oneWires on far side tie straight back to cliff. Tunnel was quite small, Dmitry would have to duck.
Platform is just suspended with 3" gap either end, so moves around, good for earthquake protection.or 185km from K2, was stopped me at police check point in Dassu, 'Where is U'r petmit? - there is snow on ground and it is a war zone'. Perhaps a good result, as would take another 2hrs to 4pm, then how to get out before dark?    So must soon up sticks and get down to Lahore to see border performance near Amritza.« Previous Entry Next Entry »
