Asia » PakistanSeptember 25th 2015 Published: November 10th 2017Edit Blog PostHarryTheDirtyDogRoad into PakistanGeo: 36.319, 74.6643Spent the first couple of days in Northern Pakistan hunkered down camped at the back of a village on the edge of a Glacier. Glaciers are everywhere around here, the mountains are massive, the peaks snow covered and the rain set in. So for those of you who are not sure the wind blowing across a frozen river, blowing down a valley through our camp combined with rain makes for very cold. So whilst waiting for the weather to lift we hiked to the Glacier for a closer look. We Gate Crashed a Pakistani wedding, that was interestingly held in a field in the village we were camped on the edge of. On the final day of bad weather we hiked to a suspension bridge. Somewhat famous in these parts not necessarily for its maintenance regime that is for sure.We bravely, crossed a bit of the bridge, the spacing between wooden planks was about 500mm which meant there was a great view of the drop below to the river. The planks were not necessarily flat, unbroken or strapped on well so we hung on to the wire pretty carefully.Refer photos attached.« Previous Entry Next Entry »
