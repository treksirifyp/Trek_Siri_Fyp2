Asia » Pakistan » Northern Areas » KarimabadSeptember 17th 2014 Published: September 19th 2014Edit Blog PostChina JollyFrom Attabad lake we rode south to the high tourist resort of Karimabad. Stayed in 'Hill top hotel' at a reduced rate 1500rb approx 15$, always get a recommendation, for a discount.   This is a town of two forts where the Hunza royalty have lived through the ages, both are now just tourist destinations. HRH from UK is due to land here in 2017 to judge their performance as world heritage sites, nothing so grand for us. Having cup of local 'Milky tea' with the guide Mohammed & his family was something different.« Previous Entry Next Entry »
